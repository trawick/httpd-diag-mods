Changes with version 2.01

*) Build: Support Clang on FreeBSD 10.

*) mod_whatkilledus: The name of the log file can now be configured with
   the WKULogfile directive.

*) mod_whatkilledus on Windows: Add directive WKUDisableWindowsErrorBox
   to allow disabling the pop-up error handling dialog after a child process
   crash.

*) mod_whatkilledus on Windows: Handle exceptions in 64-bit builds.

*) mod_backtrace: Support libunwind on Linux, FreeBSD, and OS X.  This 
   provides better resolution of function names, at least on Linux and
   FreeBSD, so a raw address will be provided in lieu of the function 
   name in fewer situations.  OS X note: A libunwind build silently fails
   to capture a backtrace with 32-bit builds, so use the default mechanism
   with 32-bit builds on OS X.

*) mod_whatkilledus: In conjunction with Event MPM changes in httpd 2.4.10,
   properly track request processing across threads with the Event MPM.
   Previously, the wrong client and/or request might be logged as the
   trigger for a crash (with the Event MPM only).

*) mod_backtrace: Filter out internal functions from backtraces so that
   only the caller's stack frames are reported.

*) mod_backtrace: Improve formatting of a backtrace for the error log
   field.

*) Build: Add -funwind-tables on ARM platform for better backtraces.

*) mod_whatkilledus: Improve detection of httpd builds that don't have
   exception hooks enabled.

Changes with version 2.0

   Versions 2.0 and above of mod_backtrace and mod_whatkilledus are
   complete rewrites by Jeff Trawick of earlier modules of the same names
   which provided similar functionality.

   The original versions of the modules were written by me and, with the
   permission by my employer at the time, submitted to the Apache
   HTTP Server Project for possible inclusion.  They were accepted to
   Apache HTTP Server 1.3 and committed in February 2004.  They were not
   committed to the Apache HTTP Server 2.x tree, but instead were distributed
   from http://people.apache.org/~trawick/ for many years.
