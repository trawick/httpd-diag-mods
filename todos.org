* 1st release tasks
** Build testing
*** Windows
**** DONE Create testbed with ASF 2.2, ApacheLounge 2.4
**** DONE Create automated test script or checklist, with mechanism for saving results
*** Linux
**** DONE Create testbed with 2.2 and 2.4
**** DONE Create automated test script with mechanism for saving results
**** TODO Compare with output of original mod_whatkilledus and mod_backtrace
*** Solaris, FreeBSD, OS X
**** DONE something similar to Linux
** diag.c/diag.h
*** DONE Add better test coverage to testdiag
*** DONE Remove DIAG_MODE_xxx; either you provide context info or you don't
*** DONE Implement SA_SIGINFO exception info, especially on Solaris where the context can be used for the backtrace
*** DONE Implement ucontext_t on Solaris
*** DONE See if anything better than the Linux API is available on FreeBSD
*** DONE Provide a way to bypass SymInitialize()
*** DONE What to do about SymInitialize() when the caller doesn't handle it?
*** DONE Implement missing features on Windows
*** DONE (handled differently) Make sure we respect platform defines added by httpd
*** DONE Get callers to call backtrace at startup to force loading of native functions so that dynamic linker isn't used in a signal handler.
*** DONE Tiny automated regression test for 32-bit and 64-bit.
** mod_backtrace.c/mod_backtrace.h
*** DONE Handle SymInitialize() on Windows with warnings for missing .pdb files for httpd, automatically adding to existing symbol path, etc.
*** DONE Add error log handler for 2.2
*** DONE Add a way to control backtrace in error log based on severity and string matching and maybe APR error code
*** DONE Change backtrace-handler to generate backtrace in different flavors for automated regression testing
*** DONE Tiny automated regression test for 32-bit and 64-bit.  It must check the backtrace in the error log.
** mod_whatkilledus.c
*** DONE Ensure that only the first crashing thread in the process gets to do any work
*** DONE Create a log file to contain crash reports
*** DONE Exit with error if EnableExceptionHook is not on (Unix only)
*** DONE Basic implementation of original mod_whatkilledus feature.
*** DONE Escape nasty stuff in the headers.
*** DONE Fix thread-safety of request-specific data.
*** DONE Add ways to filter out certain logging.
*** DONE Don't compile in the crash handler by default.
*** DONE Back out the exception filter as appropriate.
*** DONE Regression test once original feature is implemented.
*** DONE Report should give the pid of the crashing process.
*** DONE mod_crash should display pid for regression testing.
*** DONE Allow portions of URL to be obscured.
*** TODO Load testing with different MPMs
*** DONE mod_crash: add ways to crash with connection-but-not-request and no-connection, and test with mod_whatkilledus
*** DONE Regression: Ensure that the exit signal message or Windows equivalent is logged, possibly after a delay.  Ensure that Greg's "Seg fault" message is not logged.
*** DONE Regression: Test obscuring of request line fields
*** DONE Provide information about client connection.
*** DONE Simplify directive names.
** Web site and documentation
*** TODO Create it!
*** TODO Replace old information from http://people.apache.org/~trawick/
*** TODO Create release mechanism, document how to build
**** Need /usr/ports/devel/libexecinfo on FreeBSD
*** TODO Change people.apache.org artifacts to point to emptyhammock as appropriate.
*** TODO Credit where credit is due

Essentially: The API is not frozen.  Let me know if you use this.
