*** DONE Regression: Test obscuring of request line fields
*** DONE Provide information about client connection.
*** DONE Simplify directive names.
** Web site and documentation
*** DONE Create it!
*** DONE Document how to build

** TODO Decide what to do with this old text from the web page:
    <h2>Future plans</h2>

    <p>Here are some possible work items for the future:</p>

    <h3>Windows</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Prepare 64-bit binaries for Apache httpd 2.2 and 2.4.</li>
      <li>Add more information about the exception to the mod_whatkilledus log.</li>
      <li>Obtain the module name for each frame in the backtrace.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Unix</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Implement low-level APIs to control core dumps, and exploit
      those APIs in mod_whatkilledus in order to provide such features
      as informing about core dump enablement, limiting the number of
      core dumps created, etc.</li>
      <li>Update low-level APIs to include more information about the
      cause of the crash.  These can be enabled in the modules for
      httpd after future changes to the httpd APIs.
    </ul>

    <h3>General</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Clean up and formalize the low-level <em>diag</em> APIs for
      handling the system-specific details (crash description,
      backtrace) so that other programs may use them.</li>
      <li>Clean up and formalize the mod_backtrace APIs so that other
      Apache httpd modules can use them.</li>
      <li>Allow the mod_whatkilledus log file to be configured.</li>
      <li>Add more configurability for error log backtrace
      selection.</li>
      <li>Add more granular control over obscuring of request details
      that can be logged, such as obscuring an individual cookie or
      query argument and leaving others visible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Desired changes to Apache httpd</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Windows: Implement the exception hook API.  Currently
      mod_whatkilledus handles this internally on the Windows
      platform, but an exception hook would provide a framework for
      multiple modules to provide insight into crashes or clean up
      critical resources without conflicting with each other.</li>
      <li>Unix: Update httpd's signal handler setup and signal handler
      implementation to provide more information to exception hooks.
      Structures like siginfo_t and ucontext_t could provide more
      information about the cause of the crash and, in some limited
      circumstances, allow a better backtrace to be generated.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you'd like to sponsor specific enhancements whether or not
    they are listed above, please let me know.</p>

** TODO move to Github
** TODO automated tarball test
** TODO config.sh which uses libunwind automatically?
